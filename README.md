This video is a demo that helps a user find the cheapest flight from the US to Europe. Although many platforms show you the cheapest way to get to a certain place in Europe, mine can show you the cheapest flights to anywhere in Europe. For each day of any month, you’ll know the flight combination and flight info of cheapest flight to get to Europe. Once you're within Europe, flights are a lot less expensive.
